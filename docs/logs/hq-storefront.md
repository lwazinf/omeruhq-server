# OmeruIO — Web App CHANGELOG

> **Rules that govern every entry in this file:**
> 1. **Surgical changes only.** Touch nothing outside the scope of the stated fix.
> 2. **Always start from a working state.** No commit may leave the site broken or undeployable.
> 3. **We do not create bugs.** Every change is reviewed against the Known Issues list and the scores below.
> 4. **Every entry must include:** what changed · why · date · time · version bump.
> 5. **Scores are recalculated** on every release that materially changes behaviour.
> 6. **Priority order for fixes** is defined in the Roadmap section. Do not reorder without discussion.
> 7. **Every code change entry must include a Rollback block** — the exact before-state of every line touched, so any version can be restored by reversing the diff. No entry is complete without it.

## Rollback Protocol

To roll back to any previous version, say: **"roll back to vX.Y.Z"**

Each changelog entry below contains a `### Rollback` block listing every file and the exact code that was in place *before* that version's changes. Changes are reversed in **reverse version order** — newest first — until the target version is reached.

> **Current rollback state: v1.11.0** — all changes through security headers, rate limiting, product pages, deep-link fixes, error pages, store search, Sentry, analytics, and test suite are live.

## About This App

### What hq.omeru.io Is

`hq.omeru.io` is the **public web face of the Omeru platform** — a Next.js 16 application with two distinct purposes on a single codebase:

1. **Marketing landing page** (`/`) — Converts SA merchants into applicants and SA shoppers into WhatsApp bot users. Presents the platform value proposition, pricing tiers, and social proof.

2. **Merchant storefront host** (`/@[handle]`, `/@[handle]/products/[id]`, `/stores`) — Every active merchant gets a public, SEO-indexed web storefront auto-generated from their WhatsApp bot data. Products and services are listed with direct deep-links back into the WhatsApp bot.

### Why It Matters

The web app is the **discovery and SEO layer** for a platform that transacts entirely on WhatsApp. WhatsApp conversations are not indexed by search engines. Without this layer, Omeru merchants would have zero organic web presence. A customer searching "Cape Town home baker" on Google can land on a merchant's storefront, tap "Order on WhatsApp", and complete a purchase — all within 60 seconds.

### Business Use Cases

| Use Case | Route | Mechanism |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| Merchant acquisition | `/` | Landing page → apply CTA |
| Customer acquisition (organic) | `/@[handle]` | Google indexes each storefront; deep-links to WhatsApp |
| Individual product SEO | `/@[handle]/products/[id]` | Product pages with schema.org JSON-LD, OG image, canonical URL |
| Store discovery | `/stores` | Searchable, categorised directory |
| Social sharing | `/@[handle]` | Per-store OpenGraph for WhatsApp/Twitter/Facebook previews |
| Web KYC onboarding | `/kyc/[token]` | Secure document upload outside WhatsApp |

---

## Vision & Build Map

### Architecture

| Layer | Technology | Role |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Framework | Next.js 16 (App Router) | SSR + ISR for all routes |
| Database | Prisma + shared DB with bot | Same schema — web reads what bot writes |
| Styling | CSS custom properties + inline styles + minimal Tailwind | Design system in `globals.css` |
| Animation | Framer Motion + GSAP + ScrollTrigger | Hero, section reveals |
| Scroll | Lenis (smooth scroll) | Smooth scroll with nav offset support |
| Deployment | Vercel (expected) | ISR revalidation requires edge-compatible host |

### Routes

| Route | Revalidate | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `/` | Static (on deploy) | Marketing landing page |
| `/stores` | 600s | Searchable store directory, grouped by category |
| `/@[handle]` | 300s | Individual merchant storefront |
| `/@[handle]/products/[id]` | 300s | Individual product page with JSON-LD |
| `/kyc/[token]` | No cache | Merchant KYC web form |
| `/sitemap.xml` | 3600s | Dynamic sitemap: all active merchants |
| `/robots.txt` | Static | Standard crawl directives |

## Current Scores

> Last updated: **2026-06-25** | Version: **v1.12.0**

| Dimension | Score | Justification |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| **Usability** | 9.7/10 | Store search works at scale. Individual product pages for SEO. Category filters. Stores in nav. Deep-link CTAs open exact product/service in bot. All copy accurate — no stale merchant-WA management language. Deduction: no self-serve application form (CTA leads to modal, not auto-processed). |
| **Security** | 9.0/10 | Full CSP (including gtag, analytics, fonts). HSTS with 2-year max-age + preload. X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN. KYC route rate-limited (IP + token). Invite rate-limited (3/IP/hr), validated, and length-capped. Deductions: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` not set in deployment env. |
| **Reliability** | 9.0/10 | `error.tsx` catches all runtime errors and forwards to Sentry. `not-found.tsx` handles 404s. ISR correct. `displayableImage` filters expired media IDs. Rate limiters protect API routes. Test suite covers core utilities (19 tests). Deductions: no `loading.tsx`, product pages not in sitemap.xml, raw `<img>` tags bypass Next.js image optimization, fonts render-blocking via CSS `@import`. |
| **User Experience** | 9.7/10 | Beautiful mobile layout across all screen sizes — OmeruIO and OmeruHQ. Section headers adapt cleanly. Sticky WhatsApp CTA on storefront. iOS tap targets smooth. OmeruHQ portal fully usable on mobile via sidebar drawer. Deductions: no skeleton loading states, no WhatsApp share button on product pages. |
| **Logical Pathways** | 9.0/10 | Deep-link commands (`prod_`, `cbk_svc_`, `c_book_`) correctly map to bot handlers. Category + search filters are independent and compose correctly. Error boundaries catch at the right scope. Sitemap includes all storefronts. Deductions: individual product pages absent from sitemap.xml, `'use client'` on `app/page.tsx` prevents RSC static optimisation. |
| **Overall Average** | **9.3/10** | Copy accurate and product-current. Mobile experience now first-class on both OmeruIO and OmeruHQ. Remaining gaps are infrastructure (Sentry DSN, GA ID in env), performance polish (next/image, fonts), and SEO coverage (product sitemap). |

## Known Issues

### ✅ RESOLVED

| # | Issue | Fixed In | Fix Summary |
|---|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `/stores` not linked from landing page | v1.1.0 | Added to Nav.tsx desktop + mobile menu |
| 6 | Payment provider inconsistency (PayFast vs Stitch) | v1.1.0 | All references aligned to Stitch |
| 7 | Hours showed "00:00–00:00" for closed days | v1.1.0 | Renders "Closed" when `open_time === '00:00'` |
| 10 | `layout.tsx` keywords referenced wrong payment provider | v1.1.0 | Updated to Stitch |
| 3 | `next.config.ts` was empty — no headers, no security | v1.2.0 | Full security header suite added |
| 8 | No error boundaries — Next.js default error UI | v1.7.0 | Branded `error.tsx` + `not-found.tsx` |

---

### 🟠 HIGH

| # | Issue | File | Impact |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 2 | **`app/page.tsx` marked `'use client'`** — The root page is a Client Component despite having no client-side logic. Prevents Next.js from statically optimising the landing page shell. Dynamic imports with `ssr: false` are the correct pattern for the two client-only sub-components. | `app/page.tsx:1` | Delayed first paint, suboptimal LCP |
| 4 | **Raw `<img>` tags** — Three uses in `/@[handle]/page.tsx` and one in `/stores/page.tsx`. Bypass Next.js Image optimisation: no WebP conversion, no LCP hint, no responsive `srcset`, no lazy loading. | `app/[handle]/page.tsx:163, 211, 244` | Slower loads, lower Core Web Vitals |
| 14 | **Product pages absent from sitemap.xml** — `app/sitemap.ts` generates URLs for storefronts but not for individual products. A product page at `/@handle/products/[id]` is only discoverable if linked from its storefront — not directly indexed. | `app/sitemap.ts` | Missed SEO coverage for potentially thousands of products |

---

### 🟡 MEDIUM

| # | Issue | File | Impact |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 5 | **Fonts loaded via CSS `@import` (render-blocking)** — `globals.css:1` uses `@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/')`. CSS `@import` is render-blocking, slower than a `<link rel="preload">` or `next/font`. Causes flash of unstyled text on first visit. | `app/globals.css:1` | FOUT, slower LCP |
| 11 | **Hardcoded pricing on landing page** — "R199 Starter from /mo" is a static string. If the Starter price changes, it requires a code change + deploy. | `components/Hero.tsx` | Manual maintenance burden on pricing changes |
| 12 | **Product/service image height inconsistency** — Services use `height: 180`, products use `height: 220` on the same storefront. Creates mismatched visual rhythm when both appear together. | `app/[handle]/page.tsx:211, 244` | Minor visual inconsistency |
| 13 | **No loading.tsx skeleton states** — Route transitions between storefront, stores directory, and product pages show a blank screen while the Next.js RSC payload loads. No skeleton or spinner. | `app/[handle]/`, `app/stores/`, `app/[handle]/products/` | Poor perceived performance on slow connections |
| 15 | **No WhatsApp share button on product pages** — Individual product pages (`/@handle/products/[id]`) have no "Share on WhatsApp" CTA. A user who discovers a product cannot share it directly to a contact without copying the URL. | `app/[handle]/products/[productId]/page.tsx` | Missed viral loop opportunity |
| 16 | **Sentry and analytics env vars not set in deployment** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` are wired in code but absent from the Vercel/deployment environment. Both features silently no-op until provisioned. | `.env` (deployment) | No error visibility, no analytics data |

---

### 🔵 LOW

| # | Issue | File | Impact |
|---|-------|------|--------|
| 9 | **Tailwind imported but barely used** — `globals.css:2` imports Tailwind v4. Nearly all styling is inline or CSS custom properties. The import adds CSS payload for unused utilities. | `app/globals.css:2` | Minor CSS bundle bloat |
| 17 | **Rate limiters are in-memory** — Next.js API route rate limiters (`lib/rateLimit.ts`) reset on cold starts and don't coordinate across serverless instances. The invite form (3/IP/hr) and KYC routes can be bypassed via parallel invocations against different instances. | `lib/rateLimit.ts` | Rate limit bypass at scale; low risk for current traffic |

---

## Changelog Entries

### v1.0.0 — 2026-06-21 09:00 SAST
**Initial codebase audit and baseline scoring. No code changes.**

- Full audit of all app routes, components, lib files, config, and Prisma schema
- Established baseline scores across all four dimensions
- Documented 12 known issues (3 high, 5 medium, 4 low)
- Created this CHANGELOG.md as the persistent project memory document
- No regressions introduced — no code was changed

**What the app can do at v1.0.0:** Landing page, merchant storefronts, and store directory are live. Hours show "00:00–00:00" for closed days. `/stores` not linked from landing nav. Payment provider named inconsistently. No security headers. No error boundaries.

---

### v1.1.0 — 2026-06-21 18:05 SAST
**Fix #7 — Hours display. Fix #6 — Payment provider consistency. Fix #1 — /stores in nav.**

**Hours fix:** Storefront rendered `open_time` / `close_time` literally. When a merchant set "closed" during onboarding, the bot stored `00:00`. The storefront showed "Mon–Fri 00:00–00:00". Now renders "Closed" when `open_time === '00:00'`.

**Payment provider:** Hero said "Powered by PayFast". `layout.tsx` keywords said "Stitch payments". Backend uses Stitch Money. All references now say "Stitch" consistently.

**Stores in nav:** Added `{ label: 'Stores', href: '/stores' }` to Nav.tsx. Desktop nav and mobile full-screen menu route to `/stores` as a page navigation (not scroll-to-section).

**Score impact:** UX 9→9.5 · Logical 7→8.5 · Usability 8→9

**What the app can do at v1.1.0:** Storefronts show "Closed" for closed days. Consistent Stitch branding. `/stores` discoverable from main landing nav.

### Rollback to v1.0.0
| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `app/[handle]/page.tsx` | 192–194 | `Mon–Fri {merchant.open_time}–{merchant.close_time} · Sat {merchant.sat_open_time}–{merchant.sat_close_time}` |
| `components/Hero.tsx` | 72, 83 | `Powered by PayFast` (both slides) |
| `app/layout.tsx` | 8 | `keywords: "...Stitch payments..."` |
| `components/Nav.tsx` | 6–11 | navItems array had no Stores entry |
| `components/Nav.tsx` | 86, 163 | All nav items used `handleNavClick` scroll handler unconditionally |

---

### v1.2.0 — 2026-06-23 09:00 SAST
**Fix #3 — Security headers suite: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.**

**Why this mattered:** `next.config.ts` was entirely empty. All requests returned without any security headers. Clickjacking via iframe embedding was trivially possible. Browsers had no HTTPS enforcement signal. Cross-origin resource leakage could occur via `Referer` header. No Content Security Policy meant any injected script could load external resources.

**What changed:**

*`next.config.ts`*
- Added `async headers()` returning security headers for all routes `'/(.*)'`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — prevents MIME-type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` — blocks clickjacking from third-party iframes
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` — legacy XSS filter for older browsers
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` — no full URL leakage on cross-origin navigation
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()` — locks down browser feature access
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` — 2-year HTTPS enforcement, preload-eligible
- `Content-Security-Policy` — allowlist for scripts (self, GTM, GA), styles (self, Google Fonts), fonts (self, gstatic), images (self, data, blob, https), connect (self, GA), frame-src none, object-src none, base-uri self, form-action self, upgrade-insecure-requests. Note: `unsafe-inline` required for JSON-LD `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and Framer Motion/GSAP inline styles.

**Score impact:** Security 0→9 (new dimension) · Reliability 7→8

### Rollback to v1.1.0
| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `next.config.ts` | entire file | `const nextConfig: NextConfig = {}; export default nextConfig;` — no `headers()` function |

---

### v1.3.0 — 2026-06-23 10:00 SAST
**KYC API route rate limiting — IP-based on GET, token-based on PATCH and POST.**

**Why this mattered:** The `/api/kyc/[token]` route was publicly accessible with no rate limiting. GET was enumerable — an attacker could brute-force UUID tokens. PATCH (autosave) and POST (submit) had no throttle.

**What changed:**

*`lib/rateLimit.ts`* (new file — same session as this change)
- Shared sliding-window in-memory rate limiter + `clientIp(headers)` helper
- `setInterval` with `.unref()` sweeps expired entries every 5 min

*`app/api/kyc/[token]/route.ts`*
- GET: `isRateLimited('kyc-get:${clientIp(...)}', 20, 60_000)` — 20 GET requests/IP/min; prevents token enumeration
- PATCH: `isRateLimited('kyc-patch:${token}', 30, 60_000)` — 30 saves/token/min; generous for autosave
- POST: `isRateLimited('kyc-post:${token}', 10, 60_000)` — 10 uploads+submits/token/min

**Score impact:** Security 9→9 (ceiling maintained) · Reliability 8→8.5

### Rollback to v1.2.0

*Files to delete:* `lib/rateLimit.ts`

| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `app/api/kyc/[token]/route.ts` | top of GET, PATCH, POST handlers | No rate limit import or check |

---

### v1.4.0 — 2026-06-23 10:30 SAST
**Invite form hardening — IP rate limiting, email/phone validation, field length caps, dead code removal.**

**Why this mattered:** The `/api/invite` route had a dead `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block (the table was already in Supabase). Fields were written to the DB with no length limits — a 10MB `notes` field was technically possible. No email format validation. No IP rate limiting — a script could POST thousands of rows.

**What changed:**

*`app/api/invite/route.ts`* (full rewrite of the handler logic)
- Removed dead `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block
- Added `isRateLimited('invite:${clientIp(...)}', 3, 60 * 60_000)` — 3 submissions/IP/hour
- Added `isValidEmail` regex check: `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/`
- Added `isValidPhone` regex check: `/^\+?[\d\s\-().]{7,20}$/`
- Added `cap(v, max)` helper — trims and length-limits all string fields before DB insert
- Field caps: `business_name` 200, `email` 254, `whatsapp` 30, `notes` 2000, `website` 500, `city` 100, `province` 100

**Score impact:** Security 9→9 (ceiling — form is now hardened) · Reliability 8.5→9

### Rollback to v1.3.0
| File | Before |
|------|--------|
| `app/api/invite/route.ts` | Had dead `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` block; no rate limiting; no validation; no field caps |

---

### v1.5.0 — 2026-06-23 11:00 SAST
**Individual product pages — `/@[handle]/products/[id]` with JSON-LD, OG image, canonical URL, variant display.**

**Why this mattered:** Products had no indexable URLs. Search engines could not discover individual products. Sharing a product required sharing the entire storefront. WhatsApp CTAs on the storefront had no product-specific destination page to deep-link to.

**What changed:**

*`lib/storefront.ts`* — Added three deep-link helpers:
- `waProductLink(productId)` — `wa.me/...?text=prod_{id}`
- `waServiceLink(serviceId)` — `wa.me/...?text=cbk_svc_{id}`
- `waServicesListLink(merchantId)` — `wa.me/...?text=c_book_{id}`

*`app/[handle]/products/[productId]/page.tsx`* (new file)
- ISR `revalidate: 300`
- `generateMetadata` with title, description, canonical URL, OG image, Twitter card
- `schema.org/Product` JSON-LD with price, availability, seller, image
- Dark hero matching storefront brand — product image, name, price (formatted ZAR), in-stock badge
- Variant display using `variantLabel(v) = [v.size, v.color].filter(Boolean).join(' / ') || v.sku || 'Option'`
- Both CTAs use `waProductLink(product.id)` — open bot directly on that product

**Score impact:** Usability 9→9.5 · Logical 8.5→9 · UX 9.5 (maintained) — new surface

### Rollback to v1.4.0

*Files to delete:* `app/[handle]/products/[productId]/page.tsx`

| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `lib/storefront.ts` | — | No `waProductLink`, `waServiceLink`, `waServicesListLink` exports |

### v1.6.0 — 2026-06-23 11:30 SAST
**Deep-link fixes — StoreAccordion CTAs now open bot on the exact product or service, not the generic store.**

**Why this mattered:** Every "Order on WhatsApp" and "Book on WhatsApp" button in `StoreAccordion` sent `@handle` — the generic store homepage command. A customer tapping "Order" on a specific product had to browse to that product again inside WhatsApp. The specific product or service context was lost completely.

**What changed:**

*`components/StoreAccordion.tsx`*
- Removed `chatLink` prop entirely (was `wa.me/...?text=@handle` for every item)
- Added `storeHandle: string` prop (used for product page routing)
- Arrow button (→): products → `/@${storeHandle}/products/${item.id}` (goes to product page); services → `waServiceLink(item.id)` (books that service)
- "Order/Book on WhatsApp" pill: products → `waProductLink(item.id)`; services → `waServiceLink(item.id)`
- Pill label: "Order on WhatsApp" for products, "Book on WhatsApp" for services

*`app/[handle]/page.tsx`*
- Added `import { waServicesListLink }` to imports
- "Book a service" hero button: `href={waServicesListLink(merchant.id)}` — opens full services list for that merchant in bot
- StoreAccordion: removed `chatLink={chatLink}`, added `storeHandle={merchant.handle}`

**Five CTAs fixed in this release:**
1. Storefront hero "Book a service" → `c_book_{merchantId}` (was `@handle`)
2. StoreAccordion product arrow → product page URL (was `chatLink`)
3. StoreAccordion service arrow → `cbk_svc_{serviceId}` (was `chatLink`)
4. StoreAccordion product WA pill → `prod_{productId}` (was `chatLink`)
5. StoreAccordion service WA pill → `cbk_svc_{serviceId}` (was `chatLink`)

**Score impact:** Logical 9→9 (ceiling maintained, critical gap closed) · UX 9.5 (maintained)

### Rollback to v1.5.0
| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `components/StoreAccordion.tsx` | interface | Had `chatLink: string` prop; no `storeHandle` prop |
| `components/StoreAccordion.tsx` | arrow button | `href={chatLink}` for both product and service |
| `components/StoreAccordion.tsx` | WA pill | `href={chatLink}` for both; label "Order on WhatsApp" for both |
| `app/[handle]/page.tsx` | imports | No `waServicesListLink` import |
| `app/[handle]/page.tsx` | "Book a service" button | `href={chatLink}` |
| `app/[handle]/page.tsx` | StoreAccordion | `chatLink={chatLink}` prop; no `storeHandle` prop |

---

### v1.7.0 — 2026-06-24 09:00 SAST
**Error boundaries — branded `error.tsx` and `not-found.tsx`. Sentry forwarding on error.**

**Why this mattered:** A Prisma timeout or unexpected DB error showed the raw Next.js default error screen — no Omeru branding, no recovery path, no digest reference. A 404 on a mistyped store handle showed the same generic UI. These are visible to real users and undermine brand credibility.

**What changed:**

*`app/error.tsx`* (new file)
- `'use client'` — required by Next.js error boundary convention
- Renders on any uncaught runtime error within the app shell
- Shows "500", "Something went wrong", branded design matching the off-white background
- Two CTAs: "Try again" (calls `reset()`) and "Go home"
- Shows `error.digest` reference at the bottom for support correlation
- `useEffect` dynamically imports `@sentry/nextjs` and calls `captureException(error)` when Sentry is initialised (detects via `window.__SENTRY__`)

*`app/not-found.tsx`* (new file)
- Server component — no `'use client'` needed
- Renders on 404 (unknown routes, `notFound()` calls)
- Shows "404", "Page not found", message with hint to browse stores
- Two CTAs: "Browse stores →" and "Go home"
- Brand design: display font, lime CTA, off-white background, noise texture

**Score impact:** Reliability 9→9 (ceiling maintained — critical UX gap closed) · UX 9.5→9.5

### Rollback to v1.6.0

*Files to delete:* `app/error.tsx`, `app/not-found.tsx`

### v1.8.0 — 2026-06-24 09:30 SAST
**Store search — live client-side search input on `/stores` page, works alongside category filter.**

**Why this mattered:** With 20+ stores and growing, `/stores` had category filter tabs but no text search. A user who remembered a store name or product type had no way to find it faster than clicking through categories one by one.

**What changed:**

*`components/StoresAccordion.tsx`*
- Added `search` state (`useState('')`)
- Added `q = search.trim().toLowerCase()` derived value
- Replaced single `filtered` expression with two-step: category filter then text filter
- Text filter matches `trading_name` or `description` (both case-insensitive)
- Search input: positioned above category tabs, height 42, border focus animation (`onFocus`/`onBlur`), search icon via inline SVG
- Empty state shows `"No stores match '${search}'"` when search is active vs generic "No stores in this category yet."
- `setActiveIndex(0)` reset on both search change and filter change — prevents out-of-bounds accordion state

**Score impact:** Usability 9.5 (maintained — scale gap closed) · UX 9.5 (maintained)

### Rollback to v1.7.0
| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `components/StoresAccordion.tsx` | state | No `search` state; no `q` derived value |
| `components/StoresAccordion.tsx` | `filtered` | Single expression: `activeFilter === 'All' ? stores : stores.filter(s => ...)` |
| `components/StoresAccordion.tsx` | return JSX | No search input block above category tabs |
| `components/StoresAccordion.tsx` | empty state | `<p>No stores in this category yet.</p>` — no conditional text |

---

### v1.9.0 — 2026-06-24 10:00 SAST
**Sentry error tracking — server-side via `instrumentation.ts`, client-side via `sentry.client.config.ts`.**

**Why this mattered:** Next.js RSC errors and API route exceptions had no alerting. A broken storefront DB query or a KYC route error would silently return 500 to the user with no trace in the team's tooling.

**What changed:**

*`instrumentation.ts`* (new file — Next.js 15+ stable hook)
- `export async function register()` — called once per server process start
- Guarded by `process.env.NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` presence
- Dynamically imports `@sentry/nextjs` and calls `Sentry.init({ dsn, environment, tracesSampleRate: 0.1 })`

*`sentry.client.config.ts`* (new file)
- Initialises Sentry in the browser when `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` is set
- `tracesSampleRate: 0.05` (lower than server — browser sessions are noisier)
- `replaysSessionSampleRate: 0` — session replay off to avoid privacy concerns

*`app/error.tsx`* (updated in v1.7.0, Sentry forwarding)
- Already dynamically imports Sentry on error and calls `captureException`

**Env var required:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://...@sentry.io/...` in deployment environment.

**Score impact:** Reliability 9→9.5 (ceiling) once DSN is provisioned

### Rollback to v1.8.0

### v1.10.0 — 2026-06-24 10:30 SAST
**Analytics event wiring — `TrackEvent` client component, `view_store`, `view_item`, `wa_order_click`, `wa_book_click` events.**

**Why this mattered:** `GoogleTag` and `lib/gtag.ts` (with `trackEvent`, `trackPageView`, `trackConversion`) existed but were never called from any page or user action. GA4 received only automatic pageviews. The team had no signal on which stores were visited, which products were viewed, or how often the WhatsApp CTA was tapped.

**What changed:**

*`components/TrackEvent.tsx`* (new file)
- `'use client'` — client component that fires one GA4 event on mount via `useEffect`
- Props: `event: string`, `params?: Record<string, unknown>`
- Zero visible output — renders `null`
- Drops cleanly into any RSC without converting the parent to a client component

*`app/[handle]/page.tsx`*
- Added `import TrackEvent from '@/components/TrackEvent'`
- Added `<TrackEvent event="view_store" params={{ store_name: merchant.trading_name, store_handle: merchant.handle }} />` at top of return JSX

*`app/[handle]/products/[productId]/page.tsx`*
- Added `import TrackEvent from '@/components/TrackEvent'`
- Added `<TrackEvent event="view_item" params={{ item_id: product.id, item_name: product.name, currency: 'ZAR', value: fromPrice, item_brand: merchant.trading_name }} />` (GA4 e-commerce schema)

*`components/StoreAccordion.tsx`*
- Added `import { trackEvent } from '@/lib/gtag'`
- WA pill `onClick`: calls `trackEvent('wa_order_click' | 'wa_book_click', { item_id, item_name, store })` before navigation

**Events now tracked:**

| Event | Where | Params |
|-------|-------|--------|
| `view_store` | Storefront page mount | `store_name`, `store_handle` |
| `view_item` | Product page mount | `item_id`, `item_name`, `currency`, `value`, `item_brand` |
| `wa_order_click` | "Order on WhatsApp" tap | `item_id`, `item_name`, `store` |
| `wa_book_click` | "Book on WhatsApp" tap | `item_id`, `item_name`, `store` |

**Env var required:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-...` in deployment environment.

**Score impact:** Usability 9.5 (maintained — team insight gap closed) · Reliability 9 (maintained)

### Rollback to v1.9.0

*Files to delete:* `components/TrackEvent.tsx`

| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `app/[handle]/page.tsx` | imports | No `TrackEvent` import |
| `app/[handle]/page.tsx` | return JSX | No `<TrackEvent ... />` |
| `app/[handle]/products/[productId]/page.tsx` | imports | No `TrackEvent` import |
| `app/[handle]/products/[productId]/page.tsx` | return JSX | No `<TrackEvent ... />` |
| `components/StoreAccordion.tsx` | imports | No `trackEvent` import |
| `components/StoreAccordion.tsx` | WA pill onClick | `onClick={e => e.stopPropagation()}` only — no trackEvent call |

---

### v1.11.0 — 2026-06-24 11:00 SAST
**Test suite — Jest + ts-jest, 19 tests across `lib/rateLimit` and `lib/storefront`. `setInterval` `.unref()` fix.**

**Why this mattered:** Zero automated tests. Changes to link generation helpers, rate limiter logic, or the `clientIp` extractor had no safety net. The `setInterval` in `lib/rateLimit.ts` lacked `.unref()`, causing Jest to hang after test completion.

**What changed:**

*`lib/rateLimit.ts`*
- Added `.unref()` to `setInterval(...)` — tells Node.js not to keep the process alive for this timer; fixes Jest hanging

*`jest.config.ts`* (new file)
- Preset: `ts-jest`, env: `node`, roots: `lib/`, matches `**/*.test.ts`
- `moduleNameMapper`: `@/` → project root (for `@/lib/...` imports in test files)

*`lib/rateLimit.test.ts`* (new file — 8 tests)
- `isRateLimited`: allows first request, counts to max, blocks on exceed, resets after window, tracks keys independently
- `clientIp`: extracts first IP from multi-hop `x-forwarded-for`, handles single IP, returns `'unknown'` on missing header

*`lib/storefront.test.ts`* (new file — 11 tests)
- `waStoreLink`, `waProductLink`, `waServiceLink`, `waServicesListLink`: all verify correct prefix encoding
- `displayableImage`: passes `https://`, rejects `http://`, bare IDs, `null`, `undefined`
- `formatZAR`: formats currency with ZAR symbol
- `formatDuration`: handles minutes < 60, exact hours, hours + minutes

*`package.json`*
- Added `"test": "jest"` to scripts

**Test results:** 19 passed, 2 suites, 0 failures, clean exit.

**Score impact:** Reliability 9→9 (ceiling maintained — automated coverage gap closed)

### Rollback to v1.10.0

*Files to delete:* `jest.config.ts`, `lib/rateLimit.test.ts`, `lib/storefront.test.ts`

| File | Lines | Before |
|------|-------|--------|
| `lib/rateLimit.ts` | setInterval | `}, 5 * 60 * 1000);` — no `.unref()` |
| `package.json` scripts | — | No `"test"` entry |

## Enhancement Opportunities (Aspirational — v2.x)

These are forward-looking improvements beyond fixing known issues. Each would materially expand platform capability, SEO coverage, or conversion.

| Enhancement | Why | Complexity | Score Impact |
|------------|-----|------------|--------------|
| **Self-serve merchant application form** | Replace email CTA with an in-page form that writes to `invite_applications`. Removes the human-email hop for new applicants. | Medium | Usability +0.5, Conversion |
| **Dedicated `/pricing` page** | Full tier comparison, FAQ, CTA. The landing page pricing section is too compressed for informed purchase decisions. | Low | Usability +0.25 |
| **Playwright E2E test suite** | Golden paths: storefront loads, search filters stores, WA CTA builds correct URL, product page shows variants, 404 renders branded. | High | Reliability +0.5 |
| **Merchant portal hint on storefront** | "Are you the owner? Manage your store →" badge linking to the WhatsApp bot. Helps merchants who land on their own storefront get back to the bot. | Low | UX +0.25 |
| **next/image throughout** | Replace all raw `<img>` with `next/image`: WebP, lazy load, responsive `srcset`, LCP hint. Needs `remotePatterns` for Supabase CDN domain. | Medium | Reliability +0.5, Core Web Vitals |
| **PWA manifest** | `manifest.json` + service worker allows storefront pages to be installed on mobile home screens. WhatsApp-native users get a fast re-entry path. | Medium | Usability +0.25 |
| **Product social proof on storefront** | Show average rating + review count per product, pulled from the `OrderReview` table the bot already writes. | Medium | UX +0.5 |
| **Upstash Redis for API rate limiters** | HTTP-based Redis client works in Next.js serverless. Prevents invite form bypass at scale. | Low | Security +0.25 |
| **Image optimisation pipeline** | Supabase image transform URL (`?width=800&quality=80`) or Cloudflare Images for responsive product images. | Medium | Performance, UX |
| **`/merchants/[handle]/reviews` page** | Publicly visible review page per merchant. Builds trust, drives SEO long-tail keywords. | Medium | UX +0.5, SEO |

## Changelog Entries (continued)

### v1.12.0 — 2026-06-25 SAST
**Full i18n (EN/AF/ZU), mobile responsiveness for OmeruIO + OmeruHQ, content audit & merchant-out-of-WhatsApp transition.**

**Strategic change:** Merchants no longer manage their stores via WhatsApp commands. The Omeru HQ dashboard (web portal) is now the merchant management interface. Merchants receive WhatsApp alerts and payment notifications only. Customers still shop on WhatsApp. All copy updated to reflect this.

**What changed:**

*Content — `OmeruIO/messages/en.json` (+ af.json, zu.json):*
- HowItWorks step 1: Removed "Apply via email or WhatsApp" → "Click 'Apply as a merchant' on the site"
- HowItWorks step 2: Renamed "Set up your WhatsApp store" → "Set up your Omeru HQ store"; body updated to reference the HQ dashboard
- HowItWorks step 4: Added "Manage orders and analytics on Omeru HQ. Receive WhatsApp alerts for every order and payment"
- Features item 5 (Instant order alerts): Clarified notifications come via "WhatsApp and your Omeru HQ dashboard"
- Pricing Starter feature 3: "WhatsApp store + kitchen sink" → "Omeru HQ merchant dashboard"
- FAQ item 0: "Apply via email or WhatsApp" → "Click 'Apply as a merchant' on this site"
- FAQ item 5 (Services module): "all inside the same WhatsApp store" → "all managed from your Omeru HQ dashboard"
- All strings mirrored in af.json and zu.json with authentic translations

*OmeruIO mobile polish — `app/globals.css`:*
- Added `-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%` and `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`
- Added `.section-header-split` responsive class — stacks section headers vertically on ≤700px
- Added `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for kanban scroll on iOS

*OmeruIO components:*
- `Testimonials.tsx`, `Features.tsx`: added `section-header-split` + `section-sub` classes to header divs

*OmeruHQ mobile portal — `app/globals.css`:*
- Added `.mobile-topbar` (fixed 56px dark bar, hidden on desktop, shown on ≤768px)
- `.sidebar` gets `transition: transform` for slide-in animation
- At ≤768px: sidebar `translateX(-100%)` by default, `.sidebar-open` slides it in
- `.main-content` gains `padding-top: 56px` on mobile (clears topbar)
- Responsive classes: `.kpi-grid` (4→2-col), `.revenue-grid` (2→1-col), `.products-grid` (3→2→1-col)

*OmeruHQ `components/Sidebar.tsx`:*
- Added `mobileOpen` state
- Added mobile topbar (`<div className="mobile-topbar">`) with logo + animated hamburger
- Added `.sidebar-overlay` backdrop (click to close)
- Sidebar gets `className={sidebar${mobileOpen ? ' sidebar-open' : ''}}` conditional
- Nav links call `setMobileOpen(false)` on click to auto-close the drawer

*OmeruHQ portal pages:*
- `dashboard/page.tsx`: container uses `portal-page` + `clamp` padding; KPI strip uses `kpi-grid` class; revenue section uses `revenue-grid` class
- `orders/page.tsx`: container uses `portal-page`
- `orders/OrderKanban.tsx`: wrapped in `.kanban-outer` (overflow-x: auto); `.kanban-inner` → 2-col at ≤768px, 1-col at ≤480px
- `products/page.tsx`: container uses `portal-page`; product grid uses `products-grid` class

*OmeruHQ `app/login/page.tsx`:*
- Form panel uses `clamp()` padding; on ≤768px overrides to `32px 24px`

**Score impact (OmeruIO):**
- Usability: 9.5 → 9.7 (accurate copy, no stale merchant-WA language)
- UX: 9.5 → 9.7 (mobile section headers stack properly, touch targets improved)

**Score impact (OmeruHQ):**
- Usability: +1.5 (portal now usable on mobile — was completely broken below 768px)
- UX: +1.5 (sidebar drawer, kanban responsive, dashboard KPI grid adapts)

### v1.13.0 — 2026-06-25 SAST
**OmeruIO: Apply page, mobile invite routing, storefront preview CSP, modal/accordion mobile fixes.**

**What changed:**

*Apply page — `app/[locale]/apply/page.tsx`:*
- New multi-step merchant application form writing directly to `invite_applications` table
- Fields: trading name, WhatsApp number, store category, description
- Rate-limited (3 submissions/IP/hour via `lib/rateLimit.ts`)
- Replaces the old "apply via email" CTA — closes the self-serve onboarding gap
- Success state shows confirmation with next-steps copy

*Mobile invite routing — `components/InviteModal.tsx`:*
- On mobile (`window.innerWidth < 768`), InviteModal redirects to `/apply` instead of showing in-page modal
- Prevents modal scroll-lock issues on iOS Safari

*Preview CSP fix — `OmeruIO/next.config.ts`:*
- `frame-ancestors` extended from `'self'` to `'self' https://hq.omeru.io`
- Allows the HQ portal's preview iframe to load merchant storefronts
- Modern browsers use CSP `frame-ancestors` over `X-Frame-Options` when both present

*Mobile modal — `components/InviteModal.tsx`:*
- Bottom-sheet pattern on mobile: `position: fixed; bottom: 0; borderRadius: 24px 24px 0 0`
- Scroll container uses `overflow-y: auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` inside modal
- Close button pinned inside header, not outside scroll container

*Accordion mobile — `components/StoreAccordion.tsx`, `components/StoresAccordion.tsx`:*
- Added `overflow-x: auto; -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` to outer scroll container
- `overflow: visible !important` on inner flex container (was `overflow: hidden`, blocking scroll)
- Mobile CSS: active card `82vw - 16px`, inactive card `48px`

**Score impact:**
- Usability: +0.5 (apply form removes email friction from onboarding)
- Security: +0.1 (rate limiting on apply route)
- Mobile UX: +0.3 (modal bottom sheet, accordion scrollable)

### Rollback to v1.12.0

| File | Change to reverse |
|------|------------------|
| `app/[locale]/apply/page.tsx` | Delete file |
| `components/InviteModal.tsx` | Remove mobile redirect + bottom-sheet styles, restore original modal layout |

| `components/StoreAccordion.tsx` | Remove mobile CSS block (`overflow-x: auto`, mobile width overrides) |
| `components/StoresAccordion.tsx` | Same as above |

### v1.14.0 — 2026-06-26 SAST
**OmeruIO: Card swipe/tap fixed, mobile overflow prevention, stores accordion parity.**

**What changed:**

*`components/StoreAccordion.tsx` — core fix:*
- **Removed** container-level `onTouchStart`/`onTouchEnd` handlers. These were intercepting any horizontal swipe > 50px and calling `setActiveIndex`, causing card width animations to fire mid-scroll → jitter + content jumping
- **Added** per-card `onPointerDown`/`onPointerUp` tap detection: movement < 12px = tap → expand card; larger movement = scroll → browser handles natively. `onPointerCancel` fires when browser takes gesture for scroll — card never expands
- **Added** `scrollContainerRef` + `cardRefs` map to track DOM nodes
- **Added** `useEffect` to scroll active card into view after index changes (checks `cardLeft`/`cardRight` against container bounds before scrolling)
- **Mobile CSS**: `scroll-snap-type: x proximity`, `touch-action: pan-x`, `transition: none !important` on card widths (eliminates layout-reflow animation during touch)
- Entry animation stagger capped at `Math.min(i * 0.055, 0.25)` — max 250ms delay even for long lists

*`components/StoresAccordion.tsx` — parity fix:*
- Identical set of changes as `StoreAccordion.tsx` above (stores listing accordion had same bug)

*`app/[locale]/[handle]/page.tsx` — overflow fix:*
- Sticky bottom CTA: added `maxWidth: calc(100vw - 48px)` + `overflow: hidden; textOverflow: ellipsis`
- Long merchant names (e.g. "Chat with Patel's Famous Spice Emporium") no longer push the button past the viewport edge
- Hero buttons row: added `store-hero-btns` CSS class

*`app/globals.css` — mobile safety:*
- `img, video, iframe, table { max-width: 100% }` — media can't escape viewport
- `.btn-lime, .btn-outline { white-space: normal; text-align: center }` at ≤768px — buttons wrap text instead of forcing horizontal overflow
- Word-break protection on hero headlines

**Score impact:**
- Mobile UX: +0.7 (swipe-to-scroll works correctly, no more jitter)
- Usability: +0.3 (no horizontal overflow on narrow screens)

### Rollback to v1.13.0

| File | Change to reverse |
|------|------------------|
| `components/StoreAccordion.tsx` | Restore container `onTouchStart`/`onTouchEnd`, remove `scrollContainerRef`/`cardRefs`/`pointerDownPos` refs, remove `useEffect`, remove `ref` on scroll-outer, remove pointer event handlers from cards, remove new mobile CSS block, revert `delay: i * 0.055` |
| `components/StoresAccordion.tsx` | Same |
| `app/[locale]/[handle]/page.tsx` | Remove `maxWidth`/`overflow`/`textOverflow` from sticky CTA; remove `store-hero-btns` class |
| `app/globals.css` | Remove mobile safety block at end of file |

### v1.15.0 — 2026-06-30 SAST
**OmeruIO: WhatsApp bot number updated from 27750656348 → 27705736794 across all CTAs and config.**

**What changed:**

*`lib/storefront.ts`*
- Fallback in `WA_NUMBER` constant updated from `27750656348` to `27705736794`

*`components/Hero.tsx`*
- Both hardcoded `wa.me/27750656348` CTAs (customer + merchant secondary) updated to `wa.me/27705736794`

*`components/Nav.tsx`*
- Both hardcoded `wa.me/27750656348` nav links updated to `wa.me/27705736794`

*`.env.production.local` and `.env.example`*
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WA_NUMBER` updated from `27750656348` to `27705736794`

**Score impact:**
- No UX or score change — operational update only. All WhatsApp deep-links now route to the live bot number.
